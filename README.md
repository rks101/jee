Some notes related to Joint Entrance Examination for engineering in India.   

For admissions into government funded engineering institutions/universities, Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) are conducted.   

a) For admissions into NITs/IIITs/Other-GFTIs for bachelor degree or bachelor-master dual degree programs - National Testing Agency (NTA) conducts [JEE Mains exmination](https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/)   

b) For admissions into IITs for bachelor degree or integrated/dual degree programs - JAB administers JEE-Advanced examination. One of the 7 jonal IITs is entrusted as organising institute every year.   

[Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA)](https://josaa.nic.in/) was set up by the Ministry of Education (erstwhile Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD)) to manage and regulate the joint seat allocation for admissions to more than 110 institutes. This includes 23 IITs, 31 NITs, IIEST Shibpur, 26 IIITs and 33+ Other-Government Funded Technical Institutes (Other-GFTIs). Institutes other IITs are also referred as NIT+ system during JoSAA counselling. Admission to all the academic programs offered by these institutes are made through this single platform in a month long exhaustive JoSAA counselling spread across six rounds for IITs and one or more other rounds for NIT+ system (NITs/IIITs/Other-GFTIs).

**Gender Advancement**: From 2018, IITs have made collective efforts to include greater number of female candidates at the institutes for undegraduate programs. It is envisaged that IITs should admit 20% female candidates by 2020 for their undergraduate programs, thereby creating a larger pool of women in STEM education. To accommodate these numbers, over-and-above supernumerary seats were created. These seats should not be considered towards Affirmative Action, rather it's an over-and-above inclusion and diversity at institutes. Today, several IITs have a much larger pool of female population on the campus as compared to 2017 or before. Outcomes of the gender advancements will be visible in the society and industries from 2022 and years to come.    

**Vacant Seats**: The concerns were raised for seats lying vacant at IITs and for filling the provisioned seats as per matrix announced, more number of rounds were added to seat allocation exercise.   

**Affirmative Action**: As per directives from the Government of India, candidates from SC/ST/PWD/OBC/EWS category are included for affirmative action. EWS category was added to JoSAA counselling in 2019. Percentage of category wise seat for Affirmative Action (as of 2021-22): 7.5% ST, 15% SC, 5% PWD, 27% OBC, 10% EWS.
