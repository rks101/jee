For admissions into government funded engineering institutions/universities, Joint Entrance Examinations (JEE) are conducted.   

* For admissions into NITs/IIITs/Other-GFTIs (called NIT+ System) for a bachelor degree or a bachelor-master dual degree programs - CSAB administers JEE Mains examination and National Testing Agency (NTA) conducts [JEE Mains exmination](https://jeemain.nta.nic.in/)

* For admissions into IITs for a bachelor degree or an integrated/dual degree programs - JAB administers [JEE-Advanced examinations](https://jeeadv.ac.in/). One of the seven zonal IITs is entrusted as organising institute every year to conduct prestigious JEE Advanced examinations.

## JoSAA

[Joint Seat Allocation Authority (JoSAA)](https://josaa.nic.in/) was set up in 2015 by the Ministry of Education (erstwhile Ministry of Human Resources Development (MHRD)) to manage and regulate the joint seat allocation for admissions to more than 110 institutes. JoSAA includes 23 IITs, 31 NITs, IIEST Shibpur, 26 IIITs and 35+ Other-Government Funded Technical Institutes (Other-GFTIs). Institutes other than IITs are also referred as NIT+ system esp in JoSAA counselling.    

Admissions to all the academic programs offered by these institutes are made through this single platform in a month long exhaustive JoSAA counselling spread across six rounds for IITs and one or more other rounds for NIT+ system (NITs/IIITs/Other-GFTIs).

## Affirmative Action    

As per directives from the Government of India, candidates belonging to SC/ST/PWD/OBC-NCL/GEN-EWS category are included for affirmative action. OBC-NCL category was added in 1990. GEN-EWS category was added to JoSAA counselling in 2019.   

Percentage of category wise seats for Affirmative Action (since 2019): 7.5% ST, 15% SC, 27% OBC-NCL, 10% GEN-EWS (out of Open candidates). Also, 5% PWD of total seats (verticle - across disciplines at an institute).    

----

## Gender Advancement   

From 2018, IITs (and other CFTIs) have made collective efforts to include greater number of female candidates at the institutes for undegraduate programs. It is envisaged that IITs should admit 20% female candidates by 2020 for their undergraduate programs, thereby creating a larger pool of women in STEM education.     

To accommodate these numbers, over-and-above supernumerary seats were created. These seats should not be considered towards Affirmative Action, rather it's an over-and-above inclusion and diversity at institutes. Today, several IITs have a much larger pool of female population on the campus as compared to 2017 or before. Outcomes of the gender advancements will be visible in the society and industries from 2022 and later years to come.    

----

## Vacant Seats   

The concerns were raised for seats lying vacant at IITs and for filling the maximum number of seats as per seats matrix announced. 

Towards this, more number of rounds were added to joint seat allocation exercise - increased to 4 and then 6 from earlier 2 rounds. However, decent fresh seat allocations in the last round and candidates not joining the institute, does not leave options with IITs to fill those vacant seats.

## Cut-off marks

## Preparatory Course     

JoSAA allots preparatory seats (Prep) to fill vacant seats by substancially relaxing subject-wise and overall cut-off of marks obtained in JEE Advanced. Preparatory students spend one year at host IIT to make up Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, English courses. Upon successful completion of preparatory course, these students join the allotted program at the respective IIT. The precise criteria or algorithm is not known on how preparatory seats are allotted. However, these preparatory seats appear from affirmative action category (SC/ST/Any PwD).

## IIT-JEE timeline    

**1960 â€“to- 1989**: IIT-JEE examination used to have three question papers - one each in Physics, Chemistry, and Mathematics (PCM) of 3 hours each. The pattern of examination was subjective only conducted on three separate days. Initially it was known as Common Entrance Exam (CEE).    

**1990 -to- 2003**: IIT-JEE had two stages called - JEE Screening and JEE Mains. JEE Screening exam was an objective (MCQ) paper, a pre-requisite to appear in JEE Mains exam which was subjective papers as earlier. So far, from 1960s to 2003, it was a pen-paper based examination to enter into IITs.   

**200x**: IIT-JEE adopted OMR sheet for answers still continuing with printed papers.    

**2006 -to- 2012**: IIT-JEE exam was again a single stage but objective exam of 2 papers (back-to-back on the same day) each having PCM questions over the duration of 3 hours each. Candidate should have 60% agreegate in the qualifying exam class XII, and for SC/ST/PwD it was 55%.   

**2012**: JEE Advanced registrations crossed 5 lac mark, in 2010 and 2011, this number was above 4 lac.    

**2013**: IIT-JEE again became two stage examination - JEE Mains (for NIT+ system and qualifier for JEE Advanced) and JEE Advanced (for admission into IITs only). Only a certain threshold number of candidates from JEE Mains are allowed to register for JEE Advanced examination. A national level engineering entrance exam AIEEE started in 2002 for NITs and other govt engineering colleges, is now came to known as JEE Mains.    

**2013 -to- 2025**: IIT-JEE exam remains a two-stage exam - JEE Mains and JEE Advanced. JEE Mains (conducted by CBSE from 2013-2018, and later by NTA from 2019-2025) is an objective exam (MCQ) and a pre-requisite to appear in JEE Advanced exam. JEE Advanced exam has a complex multiple-pattern questions (well suited for CBT), objective questions, interger/real number answer type questions recently added, 18 questions each in PCM are multiple-correct-answers-type questions. JEE Advanced is conducted on a single day in 2 papers back-to-back, 9 am to 12 pm and 2 pm to 5 pm.    

**2015**: JoSAA come into existence for joint counselling of IITs and NIT+ system. Total seats on offer in JEE Advanced cross 10,000.     

**2017**: Weightage of class 12th marks in calculating ranks of IIT JEE Mains removed.    

**2018**: JEE Advanced exam became Computer-Based Test (CBT) being conducted online only with TCS-ion as examination implementation partner. This was a major shift from OMR-based answer sheets to online CBT. The compelling reasons behind conducting CBT are: to reduce the prospectus of paper leak and printing errors, to make examination evaluation easier (against an answer key) and swift as the number of candidates have grown, to make overall examination logistics simpler for organizing IITs (since this may not be their core business to conduct examinations at such scale). IITs are tasked to induct 20% female students in three years, e.g. 14% in 2018, 17% in 2019 and 20% in 2020.    

**2019**: GEN-EWS category is introduced to have 10% seats out of Open category. IITs are tasked to implement inclusion of EWS in two phases 5% EWS in 2019, 10% in 2020. Total seats on offer cross 16,000 in 2020.    

**2020-2021** During Covid-19 years, JEE Advanced is conducted late in the year and admissions to IITs are delayed than July-August. From 2020, JoSAA counselling is being conducted online, reporting is online and candidates need not travel in-person to the nearest IITs as earlier. Only PwD candidates need to report once to nearest IITs for disability ascertained as temporary in nature. Thus, all 23 IITs became reporting centers (RC).    

**2023**: Top-20 percentile criteria is added for qualification into IITs. In class XII, candidate should have at least 75% for Open, EWS, OBC-NCL category and 65% for SC, ST category (for five subjects including Physics, Chemistry, Maths and one language) or be in the top-20 percentile of the respective board of class XII examination. This top-20 percentile cut-off is category wise (Open, EWS, OBC-NCL, SC, ST, PWD). If board specific top-20 percentile cut-off is not available, CBSE board cut-offs are to be referenced with.    

**2024** JoSAA conducts counselling in 5 rounds in 2024.    

**2025** Again, in 2025, JoSAA conducts counselling in 6 rounds.
