## Affirmative Action    

As per directives from the Government of India, candidates from SC/ST/PWD/OBC/EWS category are included for affirmative action. EWS category was added to JoSAA counselling in 2019. Percentage of category wise seat for Affirmative Action (as of 2021-22): 7.5% ST, 15% SC, 27% OBC. Also, 5% PWD of total seats and 10% EWS out of Open candidates.

## Gender Advancement   

From 2018, IITs (and other CFTIs) have made collective efforts to include greater number of female candidates at the institutes for undegraduate programs. It is envisaged that IITs should admit 20% female candidates by 2020 for their undergraduate programs, thereby creating a larger pool of women in STEM education. To accommodate these numbers, over-and-above supernumerary seats were created. These seats should not be considered towards Affirmative Action, rather it's an over-and-above inclusion and diversity at institutes. Today, several IITs have a much larger pool of female population on the campus as compared to 2017 or before. Outcomes of the gender advancements will be visible in the society and industries from 2022 and years to come.

## Vacant Seats   

The concerns were raised for seats lying vacant at IITs and for filling the maximum number of seats as per seats matrix announced, and more number of rounds were added to joint seat allocation exercise.
